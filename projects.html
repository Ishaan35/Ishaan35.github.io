                    <p>This is a tool I created with the Angular Framework with Typescript, HTML, and CSS. It helps
                        demonstrate the process of finding the path from point A to point B. There are three algorithms
                        in
                        this
                        application which are Dijkstra's Algorithm, Breadth First Search Algorithm, and the A*
                        Algorithm.
                        Dijkstra's
                        Algorithm and Breadth First Search search all the possible nodes in similar ways with a
                        different
                        implementation, while A* uses heuristics to optimize and guide its search. You can create custom
                        wall patterns
                        by drawing on the grid, or let it generate wall patterns
                        for you. It also comes with mazes you can try out as well.</p>

                    <h2>Chess</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is a chess engine created with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The computer can play against you
                        with three difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard. The chess engine uses the minimax algorithm to
                        decide on the best move to make. The minimax algorithm examines a large tree of possible moves
                        that can be played by the computer and the opponent (human player) depending on how far ahead
                        into the game the algorithm looks. The number of moves the algorithm looks into the future
                        refers to the depth of the algorithm. The greater the depth, the better the algorithm plays. Of
                        course, the greater the depth or moves it looks into the future, the more is slows down the
                        computer since minimax is a recursive algorithm and the number of possible moves increases
                        exponentially per depth.
                        There is also a separate section related to global chess stats from chess.com which are obtained
                        from an API in JSON format using XMLHttpRequests. The stats feature the top 50 players in the
                        world on chess.com separated by different game modes such as rapid and bullet chess. This
                        website is responsive and can be viewed on computers and mobile devices.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>This is a website I created with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I created this website as an example
                        of
                        how APIs can be used in web development. Data is always changing, and static websites do not
                        update
                        their content when the data changes. However, using Javascript and APIs, websites can be dynamic
                        and
                        automatically update when the data changes. In this website's homepage, you can see popular
                        movies,
                        top-rated movies, and movies currently playing in theaters. This can help users decide on a new
                        movie to watch. You can also search up specific movies
                        in the search bar, and select your movie from the list of results. Once you select the movie,
                        you
                        will be given an entire page of detailed information about the selected movie. This is useful if
                        somebody is wondering if a movie is worth watching or not.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>This is a tool I created with the Angular Framework with Typescript, HTML, and CSS. It helps
                        demonstrate the process sorting a randomly generated list of numbers shown as bars of various
                        lengths. The
                        purpose of this project is to show how there are many ways to achieve the same product which is
                        a
                        sorted list of
                        numbers in this case, and there are better/worse ways to do it. For example, using bubble sort
                        on a
                        list of 100
                        numbers would be less efficient in terms of speed than using shell sort or radix sort. However,
                        bubble sort can
                        be very efficient in terms of using memory if there is memory shortage since there are no new
                        temporary data
                        structures being created.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>This is an app I created using Android Studio with Java. The main purpose of this app is to track
                        your blood test results for future reference. The user inputs all of the values from their blood
                        test results into a new record with a list of fields, and the app stores that data. The user can
                        also input custom data such as weight. There is also a feature that allows the user to create
                        profiles, enabling multiple people to store their data on one device. In addition to storing the
                        results, the app also has a guide which explains what all of the different values in the results
                        mean with detailed information. The user can also compare specific results such as vitamin D
                        across
                        different records from different dates, allowing the user to see if the values improve or get
                        worse. This app uses many object oriented programming principles to make code more organized, and to improve the flexibility of the program.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p> This is a 3D Mario game made in Unity using C#. I am a big fan of mario
                        games with Mario Kart being one of my favourites as it is the most fun. I wanted to attempt
                        making a
                        small
                        personal Mario Kart Game on my own and it is turning out to be a fun and interesting challenge.
                        The
                        game also
                        has AI racers which the player can race against. Not all of the
                        modelling is my own work, and certainly most of the assets belong to Nintendo. However, all of
                        the
                        programming
                        and animations present in the game are my own work.</p>

                    <h2>Super Highway Runner</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p> This is one of my first 3D games that I created with Unity and C#. In the game, the player has
                        to select a
                        car and then survive as long as possible on the road without touching any of the cars in the
                        traffic. It is an
                        endless runner which gets more difficult the longer you survive by makng your car faster. The
                        game
                        ends as soon
                        as you bump into another car. The controls are touch screen and the player moves through the
                        lanes.
                        There is
                        another game mode which uses tilt controls which utilizes the gyroscope on your phone and is
                        more
                        difficult than
                        the standard mode. The game saves your high score, your cash, and your purchased cars with the
                        in-game currency
                        as well. This game currently has hundreds of reviews and downloads.</p>

                        rolling sphere which has to avoid falling objects by rolling across the stage using the phone's
                        gyroscope. There
                        are a few themes which the player can choose from depending on his/her style and the player's
                        highscore is
                        recorded for future reference. This game has hundreds of downloads and reviews on the Play Store
                        as

                    <p> This is a 3D platformer game inspired by Mario created with Unity and C#. In
                        this game, there are a few levels which I created from 3D models which were made by Nintendo.
                        The
                        player has to
                        move around and destroy enemies, get coins, and find some interesting challenges along the way.
                        The
                        modelling is
                        not entirely my work, however all the animations and programming is my own work.</p>
